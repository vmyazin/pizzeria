# Developement Guidelines

## Build

Do not build the website every time. Only when an update is required.

## Commits

After finishing a job, provide a concise yet descriptive commit message. Do not autocommit.

## HTML Classes

Always give HTML elements descriptive and semantic class names to improve code readability and maintainability.
